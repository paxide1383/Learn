# Welcome to Some Learning and Development

This repo should be used to do some basic L&D around DevOps activities.

### What You Will Need
* A discardable github account (e.g. one using a discardable email maybe)
* A personal computer able to run Bash e.g. a Linux distro like Ubuntu, a Mac or a modern version of Windows that can run a Linux VM, WSL or Docker.

#### Exercise 1
1. From your Bash terminal clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Create and checkout a new branch from the master repo, use the branch naming convention: deploy/username_Ex1
3. Add a new text file into the directory called E1_Space with a name based on today's date e.g. 13Dec20.txt
4. Commit this change to the branch and push the branch back up to GitHub.
5. Create a pull request to have your new branch merged to become the master branch.

**Hints**
To complete this you may need to research some Git commands like git clone, git status, git pull, git checkout, git branch, git add, git commit, git push...
